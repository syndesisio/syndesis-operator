# Syndesis Infrastructure Operator

An operator for installing and updating [Syndesis](https://github.com/syndesisio/syndesis).

# States

The operator follows the following state diagram:

![Syndesis Operator State Diagram](/doc/syndesis-operator-states.png "Syndesis Operator State Diagram")

A summary of the states:

* **NotInstalled**: Syndesis resources that cannot be installed (e.g. two resources on the same namespace) are put into this state
* **Installing**: Syndesis installation started, resources are being created
* **Starting**: Creation of resources is completed, waiting for all deployments to be ready
* **StartupFailed**: Some deployments could not be started after all possible attempts. The state moves away from here if something is changed manually
* **Installed**: Everything is installed and the application is ready to be used
* **Upgrading**: The operator has detected that there's a new version and it has already started the upgrade process
* **UpgradeFailureBackoff**: A problem has occurred during the upgrade. Everything should have been restored and the upgrade process will be retried with a exponential delay (up to a maximum number of times)
* **UpgradeFailed**: After the maximum amount of failed upgrades, the upgrade will not be tried anymore. The CR needs a manual action to move away from here
* **UpgradingLegacy**: The CR can go into this state only if the operator has detected that there's a legacy installation of Syndesis in the watched namespace and there's no Syndesis resource that can own it in the same namespace. The operator then creates a Syndesis resource using a configuration inferred from the legacy environment variables


## Requirements

This project can be built with **Go version 1.10+**.

Other go binaries used:

* [dep](https://github.com/golang/dep): for dependency management
* [operator-sdk](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk): for building the operator image
* [deepcopy-gen](https://github.com/kubernetes/gengo/tree/master/examples/deepcopy-gen) (optional): for updating deep-copy boilerplate when changing the model
* [go-bindata](https://github.com/go-bindata/go-bindata) (optional): for updating embedded resources

## Building

```
dep ensure
operator-sdk build syndesis/syndesis-operator
